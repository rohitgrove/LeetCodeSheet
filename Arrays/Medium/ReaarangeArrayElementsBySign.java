    // So if this question has been asked to you then it means you will most likely
    // to get followed question as what if the order doesn't matter.
    // Means you just have to put positive and negative in alternative order.
    // Ex: [4, -2, -5, 9]
    // So your answer could be [4, -5, 9, 2] since order doesn't matter.

    // So first let's focus on the question where order matters.
    // No. of positives = No. of negatives
    // So if I start first from positive if will end at negative.
    // or Either I can start first from negative.
    // We will follow first one , which is starting from positive.
    // So next positive would be after 2 index and so on in the gap of 2.
    // Our negative would start from 1 and would step up by 2 each time.
    // Dry Run
    // Ex: [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
    // Pos: [3, 1, 2]
    // Neg: [-2, -5, -4]

    // Now put all positives at even place
    // result: [3, _, 1, _, 2, _] ( here _ means we have not inserted)
    // Now put all negatives at odd place
    // result: [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]

    // So we can see that now positive are all at even index and negatives
    // are all at odd index in their original order.

    // You : Are we good with this approach ?
    // Interviewer: Let's discuss time and space complexity, then we can go ahead.
    // You : Space Compelxity would be O(n) to store positives and negatives. and
    // Time Complexity would also be O(n) we will traverse each element twice. Once
    // for filling in positives and negatives list and second time for inserting
    // into result array at their specified position.
    // Interviewer : Cool ! Then write code for it.
